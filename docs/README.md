# ISO8583 Connector

The ISO8583 [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to send ISO8583 standard messages through the ESB Profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). ISO8583 is an international messaging standard for financial transaction card originated messages, and is commonly used in transactions between devices such as point-of-sale(POS) terminals and automated teller machines(ATMs).
Although there are various versions of the ISO8583 standard, this connector is developed based on the 1987 version. For more information on the ISO8583 Standard, see [ISO8583 Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583).
